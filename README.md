## üßë‚Äçüíª Technical Highlights

This project demonstrates deep expertise in:

- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Uses `async/await`, promises, and modern event handling for efficient execution.
- **Chrome Extension Development**: Leverages `chrome.storage.sync` for settings, `chrome.tabs` for background control, and `chrome.scripting` for content injection.
- **DOM Manipulation & Event Simulation**: Mimics user interactions with TradingView by setting input values and dispatching custom events.
- **Asynchronous Automation**: Manages timing with `sleep` functions and polling loops to wait for UI updates.
- **Data Management**: Persists results with `localStorage` and exports them as structured JSON files.
- **Modular Code**: Organized into clear, reusable functions for maintainability and scalability.
